🔍 Overview

This project aims to provide a comprehensive, fully-featured marketplace solution where multiple vendors (sellers) can register, list products, and buyers can browse and purchase items from different sellers in one unified system. Think of it as a simplified version of popular marketplaces like Amazon, Etsy, or OLX clone-style functionality (you’ll notice a folder named olx_clone)
